# Node Backend Template

## Using the Template
This is a template for a REST backend written in TypeScript including node and express.
To use it as a real project, replace the Hero implementation with you own.
Files to remove:
* `src/data.json`
* `src/routes/HeroRouter.ts`
* `test/hero.test.ts`

Also replace the corresponding code in `src/App.ts`.

## Important commands:
* `npm run build`
* `npm start`
* `npm test`
